# Web Browsing Agent with Llama 3.2, Helium, and Selenium

This repository contains a web browsing agent designed to perform tasks on the web based on user input. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies for natural language understanding and web automation, the agent operates entirely on a local machine, ensuring privacy and control.

### Features

1. **[Llama 3.2 (via Ollama)](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2)**
   - Provides robust natural language understanding and decision-making capabilities.
   - A high-performance language model designed for secure, context-aware interactions.
   - Runs locally for privacy and efficiency.

2. **[Helium](https://github.com/mherrmann/helium)**
   - Lightweight Python library for web automation.
   - Simplifies browser interactions for tasks like navigation and element selection.

3. **[Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)**
   - Comprehensive framework for browser automation.
   - Enables dynamic interactions with web elements, including forms, buttons, and navigation.

4. **LangGraph Integration**
   - Orchestrates workflows and decision-making processes.
   - Seamlessly integrates natural language inputs with web automation tasks.

### Workflow
1. **Input**: Users provide natural language instructions (e.g., "Search for the latest news about AI" or "Log into my email and check unread messages").
2. **Processing**:  
   - Llama 3.2 interprets user instructions and determines the appropriate action.
   - Helium and Selenium handle browser automation tasks based on the parsed instructions.
   - LangGraph manages task execution and ensures a cohesive workflow.
3. **Output**:  
   - The agent navigates websites, performs searches, fills out forms, and retrieves relevant information.
   - Results are presented to the user in a structured format.

### Use Cases
- Automated web browsing and research.
- Filling out online forms or managing accounts.
- Streamlined execution of repetitive web-based activities.
- Privacy-conscious browsing automation on local machines.

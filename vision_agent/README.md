### **Features**

1. **[Llama 3.2 Vision (11B Model)](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2-vision)**  
   - Powered by Ollama for enhanced natural language and visual understanding.  
   - An 11-billion-parameter model optimized for analyzing both text and image inputs.  
   - Runs entirely locally, ensuring secure and private operation.  
   - Offers advanced vision capabilities, including:  
     - Image classification and tagging.  
     - Object detection and scene understanding.  
     - OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for extracting text from images.  
     - Visual reasoning and multimodal question answering.  
   - For more details about Llama Vision capabilities, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.llama.com/docs/how-to-guides/vision-capabilities/).  

2. **[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)**  
   - Handles conversation workflows, integrating vision and language processing dynamically.  
   - Orchestrates task execution and decision-making based on both text and image inputs.  

3. **Image Preprocessing**  
   - Input images are automatically converted to Base64 strings in the first processing node.  
   - This standardized format ensures smooth compatibility with downstream tasks.

### **Workflow**

1. **Input**: Users provide **text and/or images** to the agent.  
2. **Processing**:  
   - Images are converted to a Base64 string at the first processing node.  
   - **Llama 3.2 Vision (11B)** interprets and processes the text, image, or both.  
   - **LangGraph** structures workflows and manages conversation states dynamically.  
3. **Output**:  
   - Text-based responses or task outputs are generated.

### **Use Cases**

- **Visual Question Answering**: Analyze and interpret images alongside user-provided questions.  
- **Image-Based Information Extraction**: Extract insights, text, or objects from images and respond accordingly.  
- **Text & Image Contextual Tasks**: Combine visual and text inputs for complex, multimodal tasks.  
- **Privacy-First Vision Assistant**: Perform all computations locally, ensuring sensitive data remains secure.
